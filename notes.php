//Basic Functionality and moving through the site
//Css nonexistent
//Lots of details to hash out for later
//A lot of functionality requires making the tables
    //Tables to be made
        //Login - user id, email, hashed pw, user type
        //Profile - user type, name, address, phone, availability, comments, pay, etc
                //*Unless this can be put into something like a notepad file and it's more efficient
                //Everyone (non admin) can have the same profile type, with info blank if not needed
        //Uploaded files for each user (if we allow more than 1)
        //Ratings given by others, w/their comments
        //Report table with comments from other users to admin
            //The comment, the comment source, resolved/unresolved
